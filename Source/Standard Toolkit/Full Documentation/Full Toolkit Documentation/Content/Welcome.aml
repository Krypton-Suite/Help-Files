				The Krypton Suite contains user interface components designed to make it quick and easy for developers to create professional looking applications.
				It provides the essential building blocks needed to create a consistent look and feel across all your products.
				You can use the built-in palettes to achieve the same appearance as industry standard applications such as Microsoft Office 2007/2010/2013/365.
